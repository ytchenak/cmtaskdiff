ccm histoty ....

bug in CCM: the last object is wring 

ccm history ForecastWorkspaceViewModel.cs#236.1.1:cs:2

we need don't catch the latest object. 

the pattern should be : .*Object:\s+(\S+) \(<type>:<inst>\)

def GetLastObject(self,obj):
	""" get last object for the current object
		use ccm history and find the last version
	"""
	(ver, type, inst ) = obj.split(":")
	out = self.ExecuteCmd("history %s" % obj)
	m = re.search( r".*Object:\s+(\S+)", out, re.S ) #find last occurent
								^^^^^^	
	if m:
		ver_last = m.group(1)
	prev_obj = "%s:%s:%s" % (ver_last,type,inst)
	return prev_obj
